Statistical Methods Summary for "London Bike Hires and Covid Restrictions" Project

Objective:
To analyze the impact of various COVID-19 restrictions and policies, such as work from home (WFH), the "rule of 6 indoors," and the "eat out to help out" scheme, on London bike hires.

Statistical Methods Used:

Descriptive Statistics:

Summary Statistics: Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for bike hires to understand central tendencies and variability.
Box Plots and Histograms: Visualized the distribution and identified outliers in bike hire data.

Data Preparation:

Data Cleaning: Converted relevant columns to factors and removed unused columns.
Outlier Handling: Removed extreme values to ensure robust analysis.

Data Visualization:

Time Series Analysis: Visualized bike hires trends over different years and months to identify patterns and seasonal effects.
Density Plots: Analyzed the distribution of bike hires in relation to WFH, rule of 6 indoors, and eat out to help out policies.

Correlation Analysis:
Correlation Matrix: Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to examine relationships between bike hires and various policy indicators.
Statistical Significance: Assessed the p-values to determine the significance of these correlations.

Hypothesis Testing:

T-tests: Conducted two-sample t-tests to compare mean bike hires between different groups (e.g., WFH vs. non-WFH days).
Confidence Intervals: Provided 95% confidence intervals to estimate the mean difference in hires.

Regression Analysis:
Linear Regression Models: Developed models to quantify the impact of WFH, rule of 6 indoors, and eat out to help out policies on bike hires.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model significance through p-values and F-statistics, and interpreted coefficients to understand the effects of predictors.

Multicollinearity Check: Examined Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) to ensure the absence of multicollinearity among predictors.

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):

Single Factor ANOVA: Tested the significance of individual predictors (e.g., WFH, rule of 6 indoors, eat out to help out) on bike hires.
Model Comparison ANOVA: Compared models with different predictors to identify the best-fitting model.

Interaction Effects:
Interaction Terms: Included interaction terms in regression models to capture the combined effects of different policies on bike hires.

Key Findings:
WFH: Significant positive impact on bike hires, with WFH days showing higher average hires.
Rule of 6 Indoors: Significant increase in bike hires, indicating higher demand during periods with this policy.
Eat Out to Help Out: Also led to a substantial increase in bike hires, reflecting increased mobility during the scheme.
Overall Impact: Each policy had a statistically significant effect on bike hires, with varying degrees of influence.

By employing these statistical methods, the project effectively quantified the impact of COVID-19 policies on London bike hires, providing valuable insights into behavioral changes during the pandemic.
